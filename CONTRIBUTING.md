# Contributing Guide
Thanks for your interest in contributing to [VTEX API Documentation](https://github.com/vtex/openapi-schemas#readme)! Here are a few general guidelines on contributing and reporting bugs to VTEX that we ask you to first look at.

## Contributing
We encourage everyone to participate in the building of our documentation. We usually focus our PRs on the following topics:

- New content (endpoints, descriptions or fields from scratch)
- Improvement (make an endpoint's title or description even better)
- Spelling and grammar accuracy (self-explanatory)

>ℹ️  You should create semantic commits and one PR for each API file to facilitate the technical writer's review.

### Style Guidelines
In order to generate VTEX's public API docs we use the [OpenAPI v3](https://www.openapis.org/) format and have created a [checklist](https://github.com/vtex/openapi-schemas/blob/master/OpenAPI%20Checklist.md) that contains all fields that we consider required for our API documentation. Please read the checklist before contributing.

### Review
You must add the [@technical-writers](https://github.com/orgs/vtex-apps/teams/technical-writers/members) as your contribution's reviewers. By adding the team, we will indicate the right person to review your PR.

## Code of Conduct
Please follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Contributions outside the code will be denied.
